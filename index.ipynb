    "# Distribution Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered some important distributions thus far: binomial, uniform, poisson, geometric, exponential, and of course, the normal distribution! Now it's time to put those all together and practice selecting the appropriate distribution for various scenarios.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Here's a brief recap:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Binomial Distribution**  \n",
    "Given the probability of success (such as flipping a coin; Heads vs Tails) what is the probability of 2 successes on 5 trials?  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Uniform Distribution**  \n",
    "Everything has equal probability of occuring.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Poisson Distribution**  \n",
    "Useful for calculating the probability of a discrete number of events occuring during a given time period. (Generally used when this number is small; as the average grows large the normal distribution becomes a good approximation.)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Geometric Distribution**  \n",
    "Related the binomial distribution and bernoulli trials. Rather then asking the probability of X success in Y trials, asks for the probability that the first success is on the nth trial.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Exponential Distribution**  \n",
    "Has a memoryless property where the probability of success in the next block of time is the same whether or not another success just happened, or a substantial period of time has already passed. *If the total expected number of events is poisson distributed, the time between events is exponentially distributed.*  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Normal Distribution**  \n",
    "The classic [symmetrical] bell shaped curve. Also known as the Gaussian distribution. Often the assumed distribution for unknown variables (including error).  "
